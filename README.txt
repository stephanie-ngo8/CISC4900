This workflow application streamlines the process of ordering supplies for various programs within an organization. It allows programs to list the supplies they need to order along with their associated costs. These orders are then routed to authorized approvers for approval. Once approved, the purchasing department places the order. Upon receiving the order, the program indicates on the application which items were received, facilitating the invoice payment process by the receiving team.
